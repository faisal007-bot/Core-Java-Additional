1-- new keyword 
Test t = new Test();
2-- newInstance() method
It returns object of object class so we need to type cast it into corresponding class 
Test t = (Test)Class.forName("fully qualified name"). newInstance ();
3-- Factory method
In factory method user provides static method inside the class that returns current class object which internally uses new keyword.
Eg 
Test t = Test.getObject();
Here getObject() is a static method of Test class that returns Test class's object.
4-- clone method
Test t = new Test();
Test t2 = (Test)t.clone();
5-- Deserialization
Fileinputstream fis = new fileinputstream ("file.srv);
Objectinputstream ois = new objectinputstream (fis);
Suppose our object is of type Test .
Test t = (Test)ois.getObject();
