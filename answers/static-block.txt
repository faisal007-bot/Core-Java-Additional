Static blocks should be used to load native libraries in our program.
Static blocks can be used to execute java program without main method.But it will print the error that main method is not found.
But we can prevent the error by using system.exit(0) inside the static block.
We can print something on the console without main method and static block using static variable 
Eg 1
Public static int x = m1();
Public static int m1(){
System.out.println("hello");
System.exit(0);
Return 1;
}
Eg 2
Public static Test t = new Test();
{
System.out.println("hello");
System.exit(0);
}
Eg 3
Public static Test t = new Test();
Test(){
System.out.println("hello");
System.exit(0);
}
It is possible only before java 1.7 to execute a program without main method.
